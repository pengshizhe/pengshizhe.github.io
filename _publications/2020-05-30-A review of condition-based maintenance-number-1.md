title: "(1) A review of condition-based maintenance: Its prognostic and operational aspects"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Condition-based maintenance (CBM) detects early signs of failure and dictates when maintenance should be performed based on the actual condition of a system. In this paper, we first review some of the recent research on CBM under various physical structures and signal data. Then, we summarize several kinds of prognostic models that use monitoring information to estimate the reliability of complex systems or products. Monitoring information also facilitates operational decisions in production planning, spare parts management, reliability improvement, and prognostics and health management. Finally, we suggest some research opportunities for the reliability and operations management communities to fill the research gap between these two fields.'
