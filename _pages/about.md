Weclome to my website! My name is Shizhe Peng, and I am currently an assistant professor at the department of management science and information management, School of Business, Central South University. I received a B.M. degree in information management and information system from Central University of Finance and Economics in 2015 and a Ph.D. degree in management science and engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2022. My research interests include maintenance optimization and warranty management. My research explores optimal preventive schedules under two-dimensional warranty.
